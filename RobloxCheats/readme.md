In all honesty, I started out programming Roblox exploit scripts since 2022.

Since then, Byfron (Roblox's current anticheat) has taken over exploiting since 2023.

But there are still exploits out there that bypass this but most of them are now paid.

And for the sake of myself, I do not exploit that often anymore (thankfully).

In this folder consists of old source files of my Roblox scripts (that are embarrasing now because
they are extremely unoptimized and disorganized).
