# CodeArchives
Archives of programs and code that I've worked on throughout the years.

Sources originate from former school assignments (mostly from middle school)
and my older GitHub accounts that are logged out or no longer visible.

Some sources may be slightly modified from its original for continuity and consistency.

todo:
- add obby hub scripts
- add some ozaria code
- add ranxware v2 murderers vs sheriffs source code
- add ranxware v4 sources (obfuscated)
